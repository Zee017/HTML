<h1>Project Management Documents for the  NYSC SAED Programme </h1>
<p><b>1.    Introduction </p></b>
<p>The National Youth Services Corps (NYSC ), an initiative of Federal Government of Nigeria began with the mission to promote 7 strategies  objectives amongst which are national unity and integration, dignity of labour and self reliance. The scheme was borne out of the exigencies and the post Nigeria Civil war re-construction rehabilitation and re-integraton. Under the scheme, young graduates are mobilized and deployed nationwide for a compulsory one-year service. They are deployed to states other than their own, to learn and work for one calender year. </p>
<b>2.      Contextual Background </b><br><br>
<b>2.1.    Problem statement analysis </b><br><br>
One of the fallouts of the global economic meltdown is the increase in the level of youth unemployment across the nation. According to the ILO, global active youths age 15-64 years, 81 million were unemployed as at the end of the 2009.
<p><b>2.2.    Justification </p></b>
<p>In the recognition of the need to tackle the unemployment in Nigeria, there have been developmental initiatives across various sectors and tiers of government to address the issues. Some of the obvious limitations of these interventions include:</p>
 <ol type="a">
 <li>All put together, the current interventions in public, private and non-profit sector reach fewer than 100,000 youth per annum</li> <li>Interventions are not youth specific </li>
<li>Poor collaboration and cooperation amongst sectors </li>
<li>Curriculum are outdated and more of theories than pratical</li>
<li>Packages not able to address the needs of the target beneficiaries </li>
     </ol>
